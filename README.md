The Tool Anchor is used to readjust the anchors of a widget at its extremities.




You need to start by entering the width (Width) and height (Height) of the parent widget into the Tool Anchor.

To do this, we need to switch to Custom mode, as shown in the image below.

Then you need to transfer the Width and Height values into the tool by pasting them into the Tool.

For the next step, we need to pass the widget we want to adjust into the Tool.

You then need to paste it into the Widget section of the Tool.

Once these three steps are completed, you just need to copy the adjusted anchor to paste it onto the widget that needs adjusting.

Once this is done, the anchors will be adjusted.
